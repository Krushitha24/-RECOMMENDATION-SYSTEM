# A movie recommendation system helps users discover films they are likely to enjoy by analyzing their past preferences and ratings. In this project, two datasets are used: movies.csv, which contains details like movie titles and genres, and ratings.csv, which records how different users rated various movies. The system works mainly using two methods—content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. Content-based filtering suggests movies similar to those a user already likes by looking at features such as genre. Collaborative filtering, on the other hand, looks at patterns in user behavior, recommending movies liked by users with similar tastes. These two approaches can also be combined into a hybrid system for more accurate suggestions. To prepare the data, steps like cleaning missing values, converting timestamps, and grouping similar users or movies are done to improve performance. The system’s accuracy is measured using tools like RMSE or MAE to compare predicted ratings with actual ones. In the end, this recommendation system makes it easier for users to find movies they will enjoy, offering a more personalized and enjoyable movie-watching experience.
